# most Basic Media Center
A media center with only the essential functions.
The inspiration for this project comes from my experience using [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/), which is a very feature rich, cross platform media center application with available add-ons for every imaginable use case.  I used kodi for years running on different machines connected to my good ol' CRT Tv.
I couldn't get used to the cluttered user interface, which is impossible to control from the remote control app without looking down at it. My other problem is I couldn't find a skin which is easily readable from a distance on my stunning low-res screen.

I'm fine with editing config files from time to time, what I'm not fine with is getting lost in a user interface every time I attempt to use it. So the project goals has been born:
- be able to list and open files
- control the GUI and playback from my phone without looking down
- stutter free playback on raspberry pi
- don't add any unnecessary functions
